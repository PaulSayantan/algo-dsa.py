# Network Delay Time — Solution

## Optimal Approach

### Reference implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times, n, k):
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for u, v, w in times:
            graph[u].append((v, w))
        dist = {}
        heap = [(0, k)]
        while heap:
            d, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if u in dist:
                continue
            dist[u] = d
            for v, w in graph[u]:
                if v not in dist:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (d + w, v))
        return max(dist.values()) if len(dist) == n else -1
```
